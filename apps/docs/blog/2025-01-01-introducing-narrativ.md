## Why Narrativ?

Creating engaging social media content is time-consuming. You need to:
- Research your topic thoroughly
- Find or create compelling visuals
- Maintain consistent branding
- Format everything for different platforms

Narrativ automates all of this while keeping you in control.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Research

Enter a topic, and Narrativ:
- Searches the web for current information
- Extracts key facts and insights
- Organizes content into a narrative flow

### Beautiful Visual Generation

Choose from multiple styles or create your own:
- Cinematic for professional content
- Vintage for nostalgic vibes
- Cyberpunk for tech-forward aesthetics
- And more...

### Your Brand, Your Way

Add your logo or text watermark:
- PNG logos with transparency
- Text alternatives (@username)
- 4 corner positions
- Customizable opacity and padding

### Privacy First

Unlike online AI tools:
- Your API keys stay in macOS Keychain
- Generated content stays on your machine
- No telemetry or tracking
- Use your own API keys
