   - Example: "The history of coffee"
   - Example: "How AI is changing healthcare"
   - Example: "Top 5 travel destinations in Japan"

2. Narrativ will research the topic and gather facts

### Option B: Paste Your Own Content

1. Click **Paste Mode** toggle
2. Paste your own text content (article, notes, etc.)
3. Narrativ will extract key points and create slides

## Step 3: Configure Your Story

### Number of Slides
- Choose between 1-10 slides
- 5 slides is a good default for Instagram stories

### Image Size

## Step 4: Review the Plan

After clicking **Generate**:

## Tips for Great Stories

### Choose Specific Topics

### Let AI Surprise You
The AI often finds interesting angles you might not have considered.

### Experiment with Styles
Different styles work better for different topics:
- News/facts → Cinematic or Minimalist
- Travel → Watercolor or Vintage
- Tech → Cyberpunk or Minimalist

### Add Your Branding
Before generating, set up your brand in Settings to automatically add your logo or text watermark.
