4. Configure your preferences

## Branding Types

### Logo Branding

Add your logo to every generated image.

#### Logo Requirements

- **Format**: PNG only
- **Background**: Transparent (required)
- **Recommended size**: 200x200 pixels
- **Max file size**: 2MB

#### Setting Up Logo

1. Enable branding in Settings
2. Select **Logo** as branding type
3. Click **Select Logo**
4. Choose your PNG file
5. Preview appears in settings
6. Click **Save Brand Settings**

### Text Branding

Add text (like @username) instead of a logo.

#### Configuration Options

- **Font Size**: 12-72px
- **Font Color**: Any hex color (color picker included)

## Position Options

Choose where your branding appears:

| Position | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Top Left** | News-style, professional |
| **Top Right** | Social media handles |
| **Bottom Left** | Subtle, unobtrusive |
| **Bottom Right** | Most common, familiar |

:::tip
Bottom-right is the most common position for watermarks. Top positions work well if your content often has important elements at the bottom.

## Appearance Settings

### Opacity

- Range: 10% - 100%
- Lower = more subtle, blends into image
- Higher = more visible, stands out
- **Recommended**: 60-80% for balance

### Padding

- Distance from image edge in pixels
- Range: 5px - 50px
- Higher padding keeps branding away from edges
- **Recommended**: 15-25px

## Best Practices

### Logo Design Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Complex logos don't scale well
2. **High contrast**: Ensure visibility on various backgrounds
3. **Transparent PNG**: Required for proper blending
4. **Square-ish ratio**: Works best in corners

### Text Branding Tips

1. **Short is better**: "@handle" beats "Follow me @handle on Instagram"
2. **Readable colors**: White or black work on most images
3. **Consistent**: Use the same text across platforms

### When to Use Which

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Business/Brand | Logo |
| Personal Creator | Text (@handle) |
| News/Editorial | Logo or none |
| Casual/Fun | Text or none |

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing

- Verify branding is enabled
- Check logo file exists
- Ensure opacity isn't too low
- Try re-uploading logo

### Logo Too Big/Small

The logo automatically scales to 15% of image width. If your logo appears wrong:
- Use a square-ratio logo
- Ensure original is at least 200x200px
- Very detailed logos may lose clarity when scaled

### Text Not Visible

- Increase font size
- Use a contrasting color (white on dark images, black on light)
- Increase opacity
- Add padding to avoid edge clipping

### Watermark on Wrong Position

- Settings changes apply to new generations only
- Previously generated images keep their original branding
- Regenerate images to apply new position
