# Story Creation

Learn how to create compelling visual stories with Revelio.

## Two Creation Modes

### Topic Mode

Enter a topic and let Revelio research it for you:

1. **Research Phase**: AI searches the web for current, accurate information
2. **Fact Extraction**: Key facts are extracted and organized
3. **Slide Planning**: Facts are arranged into a coherent narrative
4. **Image Generation**: Visual content is created for each slide

Best for:
- News and current events
- Educational content
- Topics you want to learn about

### Paste Mode

Bring your own content:

1. **Paste Text**: Add an article, notes, or any text content
2. **Content Analysis**: AI extracts the key points
3. **Slide Creation**: Content is organized into slides
4. **Image Generation**: Visuals are created to match your content

Best for:
- Blog post summaries
- Research you've already done
- Converting articles to visual format

## Slide Configuration

### Number of Slides (1-10)

- **1-2 slides**: Single point, announcement
- **3-5 slides**: Standard story, good engagement
- **6-8 slides**: Detailed exploration
- **9-10 slides**: Comprehensive coverage

:::tip Optimal Length

### Image Sizes

| Format | Dimensions | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Story (9:16) | 1080x1920 | Instagram Stories, WhatsApp Status, TikTok |
| Square (1:1) | 1080x1080 | Instagram Feed, Twitter, LinkedIn |

## The Generation Flow

### 1. Plan Review

After initiating generation, you'll see a plan showing:

- **Slide Titles**: What each slide will say
- **Key Facts**: Information included
- **Visual Direction**: Style notes

You can:
- **Edit** any text directly
- **Reorder** slides
- **Remove** unwanted content
- **Add** your own points

### 2. Image Generation

Once you approve the plan:

1. Images generate one by one
2. Progress is shown in real-time
3. Each slide appears as it completes

Generation time depends on:
- Number of slides
- Image provider (Gemini vs FAL)
- Current API load

### 3. Review & Download

After generation:

- **Click any image** to view full-size
- **Download individual** images
- **Download all** as ZIP file
- **Regenerate** specific slides if needed

## Advanced Tips
